<!-- Scope
-determines what can see a variable.

-Global- top leveL, EVERYONE can see and change a global.
-- in Python these are all the way to the left.
---want to make most things a global in the beginning of your career.

-Local- inside of a function, only visible internally and to child functions -->.

<script type="text/javascript">
// This is a global variable. It belongs to..the WINDOW OBJECT!!!
	var imAGlobal = 1;
	function checkScope(){
		var imAGlobal = 2;
		// In spite of the misleading name, this is a local variable, it is NOT VISIBLE outside(above) this function
		console.log("local var",imAGlobal); // 2
		// unless you have specific reason to do this, AVOID.
		// putting window. in front of anything will access the global scope. We can still access the global variable even though we have a local variable with the same name, but we have to tell it we want the global copy. 
		// Hirarchy- Window(global),checkScope(parent),child(child) ( child can see parent and global,parent can only see global, global can't see child or parent.
		console.log("global var",window.imAGlobal); // 1
